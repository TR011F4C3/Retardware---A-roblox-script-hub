# Hey! This is a section for all you people out there who want to make a gui exploit without much coding experience.

So, the GUI is seperate from the scripts and doesn't come with the scripts. You edit the GUI in Starter GUI and then move it to workspace. After moving it to workspace,
use a GUI to LUA plugin to convert it, then add/replace what you want in the "TRUE" script. When you are done, delete the other GUI to LUA file and paste your script 
into an injector, inject and then execute.

Reminder that if you wanted to rename a file you would probably have to find all instances of that filename and change it to the new name.

Conditions:

* Don't use this GUI without crediting me, "Vaporsploiter". It must be text size 14. I recommend at the bottom of the frame. The image below shows where the placement should be.
* ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77796853/111028865-616fb580-83f1-11eb-8e9d-a5ee8f72b9d7.png)

* Don't use this GUI to make a fake Vaporware Script Hub. Change the name. Although not required, a color change would be nice.
